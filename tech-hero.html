                            Stacy Brown-Philpot is Austin’s tech hero. Brown-Philpot worked at Google for nearly a decade as head of online sales and operations, where she founded the Black Googler Network, which focuses on increasing representation and supporting the careers of Black developers.
                            After leaving Google, Brown-Philpot became TaskRabbit’s CEO and continued her efforts for inclusion, culminating in 60% of TaskRabbit’s leadership being women, while Hispanic, Black, and Asian people make up almost half of the company’s employees.
                            Since leaving TaskRabbit, Brown-Philpot has carried on her endeavors and invests in overlooked and underinvested founders.

                            Abeba Birhane is a cognitive scientist researching AI accountability. Her work focuses on the intersection of machine learning and algorithmic bias. Her work has led to finding problematic datasets, such as ImageNet and 80 Million Tiny Images. She is the founder of the AI Accountability Lab in Trinity College Dublin, Ireland. She is inspiring because she challenges the idea that tech is always reliable, and is proud to fight for equality within AI use and data.

                        <li>
                            She is a computer scientist and a leader within the technology space, where she promotes ethical
                             and inclusive design through her work on algorithmic bias and accountability in the AI field.
                            Raji worked directly with Joy Buolamwini to evaluate facial recognition technology, finding that 
                            these products were significantly worse at recognizing women of color. This resulted in IBM pausing
                             the sale of their technology and taking measures to improve its accuracy with minority groups.
