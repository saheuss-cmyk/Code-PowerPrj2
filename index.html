        <!-- Relevant quote to make page more engaging -->
        <p>As stated by Patricia Hill Collins and Sirma Birge:</p>
        <blockquote>
            Intersectionality is a way of understanding and analyzing the complexity in the world,<br>
            in people, and in human experiences. The events and conditions of social and political life<br>
            and the self can seldom be understood as shaped by one factor.<br>
