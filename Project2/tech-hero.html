                            Stacy Brown-Philpot is Austin’s tech hero. Brown-Philpot worked at Google for nearly a decade as head of online sales and operations, where she founded the Black Googler Network, which focuses on increasing representation and supporting the careers of Black developers.
                            After leaving Google, Brown-Philpot became TaskRabbit’s CEO and continued her efforts for inclusion, culminating in 60% of TaskRabbit’s leadership being women, while Hispanic, Black, and Asian people make up almost half of the company’s employees.
                            Since leaving TaskRabbit, Brown-Philpot has carried on her endeavors and invests in overlooked and underinvested founders.

                            Joy Buolamwini is an AI researcher, artist, and advocate for justice in AI algorithms. 
                            While at the MIT Media Lab, she identified AI bias. She discovered that a 
                            facial recognition software that many large companies use had high error rates for dark-skinned 
                            and women faces. Joy advocates for fairness in AI and the algorithms behind AI. In addition to her technical 
                            skills, she expresses herself through writing. She is the best-selling author of Unmasking AI: 
                            My Mission to Protect What is Human in a World of Machines, which warns us about AI and how it 
                            encourages racism, sexism, and bias.

                            She is a computer scientist and a leader within the technology space, where she promotes ethical
                             and inclusive design through her work on algorithmic bias and accountability in the AI field.
                            Raji worked directly with Joy Buolamwini to evaluate facial recognition technology, finding that 
                            these products were significantly worse at recognizing women of color. This resulted in IBM pausing
                             the sale of their technology and taking measures to improve its accuracy with minority groups.
