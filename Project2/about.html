                            Besides this class being a GenEd, it is also related to a field I’m interested in and allows me to 
                            practice more of my web design skills, something I’ve been working on recently. I’m also interested 
                            in how I can connect intersectionality in the way I design the websites and applications I build to 
                            help create a more equitable world.

                            My career interests include public librarianship, and exploring the intersection of 
                            librarianship and technology. In my free time, I enjoy reading, gardening, running, 
                            and plenty of NYT word games.

                        <li>
                            In addition to this course fulfilling a major requirement, as well as counting towards my graduate degree, 
                            I am interested in learning ways that technology can be made more inclusive. This is also relevant to my 
                            career interest in public librarianship, since it is important that the library provides the public with 
                            equitable technologies.

                            My favorite technology is my smartphone, since it allows me to communicate with others, complete 
                            school and work tasks on the go, and access endless entertainment from a convenient device.
